# CSCI 4237 - Project 1 - Day Trip Planner
Day Trip Planner is a simple app to help plan interesting things to do near a desired location.

## Full Description
Day Trip Planner is a simple app to help plan interesting things to do near a desired location. Often times you may going to a different part of town to hang out with friends, see a sporting event or concert, or just to sight-see. It can be helpful to see what other activities are available around this new area. You may also be interested in what transportation is available nearby, such as the closest Metro station.
The app features the ability to enter the address of a desired destination and select restaurant and attraction types to search for nearby that address. Matching restaurants, attractions, and the nearest Metro station are all displayed on an in-app map. For each of the restaurants and attractions, additional details can be viewed (e.g. Yelp rating, price point, address, etc.) as well as the ability to call the business and / or view their full details on Yelp.
The project demonstrates the Android concepts of SharedPreferences, RecyclerViews, RESTful APIs, working with data from different systems / companies, Google Maps, error handling, Intents, and a variety of UI components.
